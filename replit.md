# Project Migration: Bolt to Replit

## Overview
This is a full-stack JavaScript application that manages materials, products, and users. It was successfully migrated from Bolt.new to Replit environment with necessary adaptations for compatibility, security, and best practices.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with wouter for routing (migrated from react-router-dom)
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Query Management**: TanStack React Query

## Key Migration Changes
- Converted from react-router-dom to wouter for Replit compatibility
- Fixed Layout and Sidebar components to work with wouter's different API
- Created missing ActivityLogs component
- Maintained separation between client and server for security
- Preserved existing component structure and functionality

- ‚úÖ Component structure preserved and fixed
- ‚úÖ Server running successfully on port 5000
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor TypeScript warning in server/vite.ts (protected file)
- üî≤ Backend API routes need implementation
- üî≤ Authentication system needs backend integration
- üî≤ Database connection needs setup
